Welcome to the Recycle.ai project repo. Please see below for instructions on accessing data and reproducing results.

#Data

Due to GitHub file size limits, the image data used to train all models can be found in our google drive at this link https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1QmOEM3Dv56K2Nb0MMRIAc4LvA4wOXoH5?ths=true. Images inside the Data folder are organized by class (plastic 1-7). Note that these class folders were combined when training the object detection model.
