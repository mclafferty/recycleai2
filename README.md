# Recycle.ai

Welcome to the Recycle.ai project repo! Please see below for instructions on accessing data and reproducing results.

# Data
Due to GitHub file size limits, the image data used to train all models can be found in our google drive at this link https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1QmOEM3Dv56K2Nb0MMRIAc4LvA4wOXoH5?ths=true. Images inside the Data folder are organized by class (plastic types 1-7). Note that these class folders were combined when training the object detection model. 

# Running the iOS Application
All files needed to run the iOS application in Xcode can be found in the recycleai2 folder. Please make sure that you have XCode and cocoapods(https://cocoapods.org) installed before continuing to the following steps. 

1. run "pod init" and make sure the Podfile matches that 
2. run "pod install" to install all dependencies
